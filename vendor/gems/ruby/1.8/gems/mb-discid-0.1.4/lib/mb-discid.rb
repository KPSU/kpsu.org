# Just a helper file to allow loading the MB-DiscID library with
# <tt>require 'mb-discid'</tt>, which is the only recommended way
# to load the library.
# 
# This file may even provide extensions to the library in the future
# to avoid to have to write everything in C.

module MusicBrainz

  # Class to calculate a MusicBrainz DiscID from an audio CD in the drive.
  # 
  # This is basically an interface to the libdiscid C library
  # (http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid).
  # 
  # == Usage
  # === Basic Usage:
  #  
  #  require 'mb-discid'
  #  
  #  # Create a new DiscID object.
  #  disc = MusicBrainz::DiscID.new
  #  
  #  # Read the TOC from the default device.
  #  # An audio CD must be inserted in the drive. An exception will be thrown
  #  # if the CD can't be read.
  #  begin
  #    disc.read
  #  rescue Exception => e
  #    puts e
  #    exit(1)
  #  end
  #  
  #  # Print information about the disc:
  #  print <<EOF
  #  DiscID      : #{disc.id}
  #  Submit via  : #{disc.submission_url}
  #  FreeDB ID   : #{disc.freedb_id}
  #  First track : #{disc.first_track_num}
  #  Last track  : #{disc.last_track_num}
  #  Total length: #{disc.seconds} seconds
  #  Sectors     : #{disc.sectors}
  #  EOF
  #  
  #  # Print information about individual tracks:
  #  disc.track_details do |track_info|
  #    puts "Track ##{track_info.number}"
  #    puts "  Length: %02d:%02d (%i sectors)" %
  #       [track_info.seconds / 60, track_info.seconds % 60, track_info.sectors]
  #    puts "  Start : %02d:%02d (sector %i)" % 
  #       [track_info.start_time / 60, track_info.start_time % 60, track_info.start_sector]
  #    puts "  End   : %02d:%02d (sector %i)" %
  #       [track_info.end_time / 60, track_info.end_time % 60, track_info.end_sector]
  #  end
  #  
  #  # Print a submission URL that can be used to submit
  #  # the disc ID to MusicBrainz.org.
  #  puts "\nSubmit via #{disc.submission_url}"
  #  
  # === Specifying the device to read from:
  # 
  #  # Create a new DiscID object and read the disc in /dev/dvd:
  #  disc = MusicBrainz::DiscID.new
  #  disc.read('/dev/dvd')
  #  
  #  # Create a new DiscID object and directly read the disc in /dev/dvd:
  #  disc = MusicBrainz::DiscID.new('/dev/dvd')
  #  
  #  # Create a new DiscID object and directly read the disc in the platform's
  #  # default device:
  #  disc = MusicBrainz::DiscID.new(MusicBrainz::DiscID.default_device)
  #  
  # === Calculating the DiscID for a given TOC
  # 
  #  disc = MusicBrainz::DiscID.new
  #  
  #  first_track   = 1
  #  sectors       = 224556
  #  track_offsets = [150, 9078, 13528, 34182, 53768, 70987, 96424,
  #                   118425, 136793, 159514, 179777, 198006]
  #  
  #  disc.put(first_track, sectors, track_offsets)
  #  puts disc.id # Should print "T_prJXQSrqbnH8OE.dgOKsHm5Uw-"
  #
