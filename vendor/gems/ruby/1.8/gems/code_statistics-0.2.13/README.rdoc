= code_statistics

This is a port of the rails 'rake stat' so it can be used on none rails projects and have it's features slowly expanded. Please feel free to contact us if you have any ideas for additional stats that should be added. It in general tries to have defaults that work better for both rails and non rails projects. It specifically supports cucumber tests and rspec better than the original rails stats.

todos:
* make bin accept passed cmd line arguments to run
* stop relying on ENV vars
* count number of total files
* count number of of .rb or passed in filter files
* find todo, perf, bug, hack, etc comments and display them with info about them (line number etc)
*reduce duplication between bin and task

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
