This is the public source code for kpsu.org

Several files (some which are integral, currently) have had sensitive information scrubbed.  They are listed below.

An important note is that there is a sudo cronjob to add:
0 * * * * cd /var/www/kpsu.org/current; rake archive:update
This is responsible for keeping the podcasts current.  Like the rest of the site, it requires data in the file that is not provided publicly.

While we are in the process of inserting rescues and such, these files will be made available to KPSU affiliates by request to the site administrator (admin@)

The files are:

config/.amazonrc
  key_id
  secret_key_id
config/lastfm.yml
  api_key
  api_secret
config/newrelic.yml
  license_key
config/database.yml
